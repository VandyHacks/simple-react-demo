Simple React Demo
==

Steps
--

1. Install [Node.js 8](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

2. If you are on Windows, install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads). If you are on Mac, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and run `brew install git`

3. Log off and log back in.

4. Open a shell, `cd` into the directory where you want to store the repository, and run `git clone https://github.com/VandyHacks/simple-react-demo.git`

5. Run `cd simple-react-demo` (change the folder name if you changed the clone location)

6. Run `yarn install` and `yarn run dev`

7. Visit `localhost:1234`, you should see a supposedly live-updating Bitcoin price viewer. The price should change every 30 seconds or so (as that's the update frequency of the data source).

8. To stop the dev server, press `Ctrl+C` in your shell.
